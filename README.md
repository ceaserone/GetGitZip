# GetGitZip
GetGitZip.Github-Repo-Downloader

Might seem pointless but when not on my phone/server/home sometimes I was needing to get a .zip of a repo quick, so I made an easy short url that i wont forget (eg: ccb.wtf/1812), and can access it quickly anywhere, easy to host and lightweight...
Demo:
<a href="https://ccb.wtf/1812" target="_blank">GetGit.zip</a>
