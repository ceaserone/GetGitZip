# GetGitZip
GetGitZip.Github-Repo-Downloader

Might seem pointless but when not on my phone/server/homebox/whatever sometimes I was needing to get a .zip of a repo quick, so I made an easy short url that i wont forget (eg: ccb.wtf/1812), and can access it quickly anywhere, easy to host and lightweight...
Demo:
<a href="ccb.wtf/1812">GetGit</a>
